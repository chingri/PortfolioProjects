The dataset used is "Video Game Sales"by Gregory Smith from Kaggle. Link :- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales

All code written was written using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 18. The dataset itself was not divided into several tables however for the purpose of using JOINS, I manually had them separated.
	
	Important Points:- 
	
	
	1) All Sales numbers are 'per million'. 63 sales made = 63 million sales made. 
	
	2) Wii Sports is the most sold game, however it must be kept in mind that the game came free with the Wii thus the sales number might actually give us the number of 		consoles sold intead
